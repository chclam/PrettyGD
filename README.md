# PrettyGD
PrettyGD makes your geographic graph drawings prettier by optimizing on aesthetics and displacement. It takes as input a graph with initialized vertex positions on the map and reassigns better a position for each vertex. The vertex positions are better with regards to various "aesthetic criteria" such as vertex or edge overlaps. PrettyGD currently supports the optimization on the following aesthetic criteria:

  1. Vertex overlaps (vertex resolution);
  2. Parallel edge overlaps (angular resolution);
  3.
